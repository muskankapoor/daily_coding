Use Leetcode to Practice: To practice coding problems, check out Leetcode. Focus on these topics: string manipulation, linked lists, doubly linked lists, hash tables, trees, queues, stacks, depth-first search, breadth-first-search, basic graphs, basic complexity.
Check Glassdoor: Many companies have interview questions on Glassdoor. Your goal isn’t to study the interview questions in advance, but you can get a good idea of the general difficulty of the programming questions.
Practice talking while you solve problems: When you feel a bit more prepared, you can do a mock interview to see where you’re standing. Check out Mock Interviews or Pramp. You will receive feedback afterwards with details about what went well and what you need to improve, which will definitely help you for upcoming interviews.

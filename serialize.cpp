/*
Given the root to a binary tree, implement serialize(root), which serializes the tree into a string, and deserialize(s), which deserializes the string back into the tree.

*/

/*Serialization is to store tree in a file so that it can be later restored. 
The structure of tree must be maintained. Deserialization is reading
 tree back from file. */
